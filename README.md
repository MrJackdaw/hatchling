# Hatch.co Take-Home Test

A basic react project with a landing page. Built using ViteJS + ReactJS + Typescript.
No additional dependencies, although it re-uses some pre-built components (`<ImageLoader />`), as well as a modified version of an ancient [animation helpers file](https://gist.github.com/MrJackdaw/0fd49364aadc69acb2aade6485d1beb9), both which I created and have modified over the years.

## Setup and run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project root in a cli:

   ```bash
   $. cd my/project/root # replace with project root
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   $. npm i
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   $. npm run dev # replace with project root
   ```

## Additional Notes

* Colors (excluding hover states) were sampled directly from the supplied reference image.
* The project uses your default (sans-serif) system font.
* This process is certifiably gnome-free. If you see a gnome at any point during or after the installation, ignore anything it has to say.
